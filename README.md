# Deploy and Host Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Web Terminal on Railway

Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Web Terminal is a browser-accessible Linux shell powered by ttyd. It provides instant access to a full Ubuntu environment without SSH configuration. Perfect for remote development, cloud administration, or learning Linux - all through your web browser with password-protected authentication.

## About Hosting Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Web Terminal

Hosting a web terminal requires a containerized Ubuntu environment with ttyd serving the shell over HTTP. This template packages Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat) with ttyd 1.7.7, pre-installs common development tools, and configures authentication via environment variables. Railway handles the container orchestration, SSL termination, and public URL generation. The included volume mount at `/root` ensures your files, configurations, and installed packages persist across restarts and redeployments.

## Common Use Cases

- **Remote Development** - Access a consistent Linux development environment from any device with a browser
- **Cloud Shell** - Personal cloud-based terminal for system administration and DevOps tasks
- **Learning & Education** - Safe sandbox environment to practice Linux commands and scripting
- **CI/CD Testing** - Quick disposable environment for testing deployment scripts and automation
